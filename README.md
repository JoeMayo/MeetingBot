This code supports my upcoming video course on the Microsoft Bot Framework that I did with Pearson. I'll update this page as the video course becomes available.

A few notes on repository contents:

* *Lesson 01:* No code as this is an introduction.

* *Lesson 02:* Examples of basic conversation management, including activities, state management, and basic interaction with a user.

* *Lesson 03:* Demonstrates how to create dialogs. Includes both IDialog<T> and FormFlow.

* *Lesson 04:* Natural Language Processing (NLP) with LUIS and how to implement LuisDialog.

* *Lesson 05:* GUI related subjects, including text formatting, cards, and payments.

* *Lesson 06:* Various tasks in publishing chatbots to channels. Includes Webchat control demo.
